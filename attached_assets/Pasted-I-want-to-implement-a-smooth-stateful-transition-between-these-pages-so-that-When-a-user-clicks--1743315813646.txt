I want to implement a smooth, stateful transition between these pages, so that:

When a user clicks the "Projects" link on the Home page, the orb animation transitions into the globe particle animation.
When a user clicks the "Home" link on the Projects page, the globe animation transitions back into the orb animation.
The main goals are:

Preserve the Three.js WebGL context and current animation state. The transition must not cause a full page reload.
Allow a smooth visual effect between the two different animations (using either a morphing technique or a cross-fade effect).
You can use additional libraries if necessary. I recommend:

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): For advanced tweening and animation interpolation.
Barba.js or Swup: For managing smooth page transitions if a client-side router is required.
Requirements:

Intercept Navigation:
Modify the click event on the navigation links so that the transition is initiated first.
Prevent the default behavior to avoid an immediate page change.

Transition Options:
Morphing Approach:
Capture the current state of the orb (geometry, material parameters, etc.) and tween these values to match those of the globe. Use GSAP for smooth interpolation.

State Preservation: 
Save any key parameters such as camera positions, light settings, and particle states before initiating the transition.
Pass these states to the target animation so that the transition appears seamless.

Implementation Details:
If using GSAP, include instructions for installing it (via npm or a CDN) and importing it in the project.
If using a page transition library (Barba.js or Swup), include installation and basic setup instructions.
Include detailed comments in the code to explain:
How the navigation event is intercepted.
How the transition is initiated and how the state is captured.
How the morphing or cross-fade effect is implemented using Three.js and GSAP.
How the target animation is activated once the transition completes.
Any error handling or fallback if the transition fails.
